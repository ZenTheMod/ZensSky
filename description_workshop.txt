[h1]✦ Zen's Sky ✦[/h1]
My attempt at a more accurate sky.

[b]Currently adds:[/b]
[list]
    [*]More dynamic sun in the style of 1.4.5 leaks.
    [*]More accurate moon, works for every vanilla moon style.
    [*]Prettier stars.
    [*]More realistic shooting stars.
    [*]Pixelation config. (Kain asked for this (Blame them))
    [*]RealisticSky compat. (Sorry Lucille)
[/list]

[h3]This mod is [u]required on all clients and the server to work[/u] due to me wanting it to be as accurate as possible for all players.[/h3]
This is also because I plan to use this mod as part of a larger content heavy mod in the future.
